## Total: ~102 tracks across 10 genres

## Time Estimate
- ~90 seconds per analysis on Render Starter
- ~98 tracks × 1.5 min = ~2.5 hours of analysis time
- Can be done in batches across multiple sessions

## After Analysis: SQL Query

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor after all tracks are analyzed:

```sql
-- Extract frequency balance data from all admin test analyses with user_genre
SELECT
  a.filename,
  a.score,
  (a.metrics->'user_genre')::text as user_genre,
  -- Extract frequency balance metric from metrics array
  fb.value->>'low_percent' as low_pct,
  fb.value->>'mid_percent' as mid_pct,
  fb.value->>'high_percent' as high_pct,
  fb.value->>'d_low_mid_db' as d_low_mid_db,
  fb.value->>'d_high_mid_db' as d_high_mid_db,
  fb.value->>'low_db' as low_db,
  fb.value->>'mid_db' as mid_db,
  fb.value->>'high_db' as high_db,
  fb.value->>'tonal_percentage' as tonal_pct,
  fb.value->>'detected_genre' as detected_genre,
  fb.value->>'genre_confidence' as genre_confidence,
  a.created_at
FROM analyses a,
LATERAL (
  SELECT elem as value
  FROM jsonb_array_elements(a.metrics->'metrics') elem
  WHERE elem->>'internal_key' = 'Frequency Balance'
  LIMIT 1
) fb
WHERE a.is_test_analysis = true
  AND a.metrics->'user_genre' IS NOT NULL
  AND (a.metrics->>'user_genre') != 'null'
ORDER BY (a.metrics->>'user_genre'), a.created_at;
```

This returns one row per analyzed reference track with all the frequency data needed to calibrate profiles.
